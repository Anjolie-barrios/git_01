Your hands easy weight,  
teasing the bees hived in my hair,   
your smile at the slope of my cheek.  
On the occasion, you press above me,  
glowing, spouting readiness, mystery rapes my reason  
When you have withdrawn your self and the magic,  
when only the smell of your love lingers between my breasts,  
then, only then, can I greedily consume your presence.
